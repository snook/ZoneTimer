# ZoneTimer
Simply displays how long it took to zone in Seconds. A couple of recent zoning improvement AddOns slim down their times by a few microseconds by not including their own functions in the elapsed time, or they show no elapsed time at all. ZoneTimer will grant you a simple base to review your load times as you optimize your AddOns.
